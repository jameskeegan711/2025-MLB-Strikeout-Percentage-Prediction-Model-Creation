# 2025-MLB-Strikeout-Percentage-Prediction-Model-Creation
 Using the past three seasons of MLB data, I created models to predict the strikeout percentage for each MLB pitcher for the 2025 season.

Data was given to me by my professor and included srikeout percentage data. I also was able to scrape the second data set from FanGraphs website for the velocities of each pitches from each pitcher.
